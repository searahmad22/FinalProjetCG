The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's
face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far
at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked
straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and stillâ€”as if the question had been
addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.
   "Why did you say that?" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense.
   The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass
behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky.
   "Why does it bother you?" he asked.
   "It doesn't," snapped Eddie Willers.
   He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped him and asked for
a dime, then had gone on talking, as if to kill that moment and postpone the
problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so frequent in the streets these
days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations, and he had no
desire to hear the details of this bum's particular despair.
   "Go get your cup of coffee," he said, handing the dime to the shadow that
had no face.
